Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, there are some exceptions, such as when a smaller numeral appears before a larger one. In such cases, you subtract the smaller numeral from the larger one. For example:

IV represents 4 (5 - 1)
IX represents 9 (10 - 1)
XL represents 40 (50 - 10)
XC represents 90 (100 - 10)
CD represents 400 (500 - 100)
CM represents 900 (1000 - 100)
